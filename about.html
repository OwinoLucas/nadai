      <h1>GAMING SYNOPSIS</h1>
      <h3>How it all started</h3>
    </div>
    <div class = "synopsiscontent"> 
      <p>In the 50's, a computer version of naught and crosses - or tic tac toe -was made available on one of Cambridge university's EDSAC computers. A decade later, a game called spacewar was made available to the masses, courtesy of a few brainiacs from MIT. Another decade later, the earliest known
        video game competition took place - a spacewars tournament. This sequence repeated itself exponentially - more advances in computer technology allowed fo a wider variety of games to be played on these machines. When the late 80's rolled by, it was too late to stop the wave of gaming that 
        captured the attention of youths in developed countries. Japanese, American and European kids in this period had access to a fantastic variety of games - super mario bros, pacman, Doom, civilization 1, are all classics of late twentieth-century gaming. 
      </p>
      <p>Leaps in commercial technology in the twenty-first century allowed for gaming on a scale no one in the past decades could have foretold. Incorporation of the internet with gaming platforms allowed online role playing games to skyrocket in popularity and reach the level of fluidity you now enjoy.
        Now gaming is global, and can be indulged in by those in all sorts of locations - well, urban areas at least. Today, PC gaming is considered the technological pinnacle of the hobby(dont @ me, console lovers!), offering the very best in terms of graphical fidelity, atmospheric audio and immersive VR experiences.
        So keep this information in mind when you sit back and play your favourite video game. We've come a long damn way.

      <p>Nadai is a video game review site, based on the tastes of PC gamers on windows and linux operating systems. The site reviews games in the slim genres of sports, first-person shooters and role-playing games - however reviews for more "vanilla" games could be found on the website in times to come - including classics from the 80's and 90's</p>

        These are the founding developers of the site. As of now, these are the people who keep the site running and add to its functionality. Each of these people has a role to play in the team - and the team is well balanced as a result of the work of these individuals. It is indeed deserving that they should have recognition and acknowledgement on this site.

        Having a narrow range of genres on the site means that our reviews are more concise than other rookie game reviews around. Therefore, any potential sponsors need not fret over lack of experience. We'll get to the pinnacle in no time!

      <p>
        We are affiliated with Moringa school, and all our developers can draw origins to the institution. By extension, we then have links to all of moringa school's partners and can reach them through our powerful network of aquaintances with moringa school students and staff.
